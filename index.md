## Welcome to Solaris Skunkwerks

In case you missed it, this project is **ACTIVE**


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.



For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Solaris-Skunk-Werks/solarisskunkwerks/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
